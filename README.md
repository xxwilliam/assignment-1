<p>Born in  Brisbane, Australia :</P> 
 
<h3>Education To Date:</h3> Year 10 in 1989, Tafe cooking in 1990, Chubb Security in 2003, Certificate 3 in Security 
Operations in 2010, Rmit Introduction to IT in 2021.  
 
 <h3>Basic Background  information.</H3>
 
 <p>I studied to be a chef in 1990 at Rockhamption T.A.F.E. After that i came back to Brisbane, and tried to find work as an apprentice chef, No luck, So i went to work with my Dad as a House Painter, We did that for a few years, That was Dad's profession,I then got a job at Wharehouse that deals in Stainles Steel. Then i got into Security Did that for abt 15 years on and off.Then my wife and me were diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I had to give up on security to look after my wife.</p> 
 
 <h3>My Interest in It.</h3>
 
 <p>I choose RMIT as it was the only  on-line University that would give me a go at doing an It course that is flexiable to my needs at this time, easy to use, the tutors are a very helpfull and are available for feedback. I am starting my It journey in, introduction to It as a stepping stone, and then I will be studying introduction to Programing after this course. I expect to learn a lot from RMIT to help me further my studies so I can reach my goal and study Cyber Security.After that I hope to start my own Cyber Security business.</p>
 
 
<p>My interest in IT came about when a friend of mine was chatting to a guy online from the USA. She was telling 
me all about him, like that he owned a Harley Davidson store,lived in a big house, and was very rich.  She also told me he wanted her to fly to the USA.She was only a few months away from going ,so I did a Google search on his name, and found out a lot about him, like he only worked a few days at the Harley Davidson store,  and was'nt that good working
 in the store, his house was his mom's and he lived in the basement, and then I found out he has a criminal history
 which was very long, and 1 of the charges was assault on a female, and spent time in Jail. I down loaded 
what I found and showed her , at 1st she did'nt believe me so I told her to ask him a few questions, and I told her to
ring his work and ask to speak to the manager. After she did all that she found out I was right and
 had caught him out on his lies. She never went to the USA.</p>
 

 
<h3>MY IDEAL JOB</h3>

<h3>MY PROJECT IDEA;</h3> 


<h3>THE G.E.C,A.</h3> 
 
<h3>OVER VIEW;</H3> 
 
<p>A module fitted to a motor vehicle to help stop it getting stolen. The G,E,C,A stands for Gps tracking, Engine 
immobiliser, Camera, Alarm. 
The GPS will keep a log of the vehicle's location, Engine immobiliser will disable the engine, lock doors and win
windows, Cameras will record from 
out side the vehicle and in side as well, and Alarms will go off out side the vehicle. The vehicle's air conditioner 
or vent fan will still 
work so the occupants will not be affected by the hot or cold weather The whole unit can be built in the front or
boot area of the vehicle, 
and wired into the vehicle's electrical system and ignition.</p> 
 
<h3>MY MOTIVATION;</h3> 
 
<p>This would be an asset to any vehicle owner, as there is approximately 19.8 million vehicle's registered in 
Australia as from 2020. This product 
would slow down vehicle theft in Australia, as there are close to 1.6 thefts per 1000 registered vehicles. That's 
close to 56,300 motor 
vehicles stolen in 2019-2020. This is just an upgrade of other anti-theft systems but with a big difference. And 
that difference is all this is in a package like they have on airplanes (black boxes) See description below.>/p> 
 
 
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT;</h3> 
 
<p>As the name suggests G,E,C,A. Gps ,Engine immobiliser, Camera and Alarm, lets discover what each 1 does;</p> 

 <h3>GPS Tracking;</h3> 
<p>The Gps Tracker will work along side but not wired into the factory gps (if the vehicle has 1), it will have it's own
battery as a back up 
for the whole system. The GPS will log the trips on a hard drive and an SD card, so if the hard drive was damage
d the SD card would survive or vice 
versa.</p> 

 <h3>ENGINE IMMOBILISER;</h3> 
<p>This will work seperate to the factory engine immobiliser ( if vehicle has 1) so if that was hacked or key was 
cloned. The engine immobiliser would  
kick in after the vehicle was driven 50 meters, it woukd send a log to the hard drive and sd card,. The engine 
immobiliser would keep motor vehicle 
engine running but only idleing so air conditioner or fan to work. It would send a message to the motor vehicle 
commputer (most vehicles have a 
commptuer) most vehicles made before 1970-1980 will not have a commputer. Also send a message to the brakes 
to close.</p> 

 <h3>CAMERAS;</h3> 
<p>Cameras will be mounted on the front,rear and inside. These cameras will record just like normal vehicle cameras 
do, The in side camera will directly 
show the driver, have a mircrophone as well the record any voices from in side the vehicle, that can be used in 
court if needed. all this will be 
recorded on the hard drive and sd card.</p> 

 <h3>ALARMS;</h3> 
<p>This alarm system will work seperatley to the factory alarm system just in caes that is disabled. The alarm will 
have pre-recorded sounds up to 100 decibels, along with a speaker in 
 side saying in a calm voice to just relax and wait for help, and the alarm can be disabled by an APP on 
the owners ph. The alarm will go off every 5 secondes for 5 mins and then every 2 minutes after that for another 5 
mins. The alarm system will disable the door locks and electric windows(if applicable).</p> 
 
<p>This Idea is based on 2 current products already in use today.1 of those products is the factory and (after market) 
motor vehicle anti-theft 
systems. The other is the black box used in airplanes, the black box will be fire proof, and crash proof, and only 
 accessed byt the owner of the motor vehicle with a special key. All parts 
 can be fitted by an authorized person, who will have knowledge of a motor vehicles electrical systems , 
and mechanical knowledge. For things such as the Engine Managment systems including electric windows, doors 
locks, braking systems.</p> 

<h3>Tools and Technologies needed</h3> 

<p>Tools requrired will be the standard tools , screw drivers, wire cutters, electrical tape, electrical tubing, spanners 
(open ended and rind), 
electrical wire (12 gauge) and connectors for the vehicle's commputer 
The technologies required will be the soft ware associated with the operating systems, such as engine immoblising
, power windows, door locks, 
and braking systems. The soft ware for the camera will be in the same black box but run seperatly with its own 
hard drive and as card. Microcontroller units: A small computer on an integrated circuit for memory and I/O peripherals. 
GPS module: A GPS device built with tiny processors and antennas to receive the satellite data and timestamps. 
GSM module: A global system for mobile communication that works as a mobile device establishes contact with a computer. 
Relay circuit: An electronic control device integration with a GPS tracker to communicate with the vehicle’s engine. 
 a power converter, it will also be connected devices via cloud IoT. The app  would be developed on MIT Appinventor. </p>
 
 <h3>Skills required</h3>
 
<p>Skills required will need to be advanced in automotive, eg electrical and mechanical skills, like fitting parts to 
braking systemsn engine 
managment systems, (commputer in vehical). Knowledge in to late model vehicles that run a carboeretta or fuel 
injector systems, A cert 2 or higher in 
automotive electrical technoledge, A cert 2 or higher in automotive studies, commputer programming can take in 
between 25 to 40 weeks or longer. Experience in cloud computering and software engineering.I would use  Rasberry Pi Model B which has ARM Cortex processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 2 USB ports, 2 GB of RAM, with a SD card memory of 32 GB of memory. The program would be developed on MyGet which is cloud based,  </p>
 
 <h3> The outcome</h3>
 
<p>The outcome if this idea was successful would be great for the motor vehicles owners, knowing that no matter what
 happens to there vehicles when stolen that the people responsible would be caught and dealt
  with by the law, Insurence companies would lower there rates as this would go down as this will be an added
 safety add-on to the vehicle. Police would catch more criminals faster, so more jails would be needed,
so that means more jobs more guards needed, and a safer community asmotor vehicle theft would 
  go down and peace of mind for motor vehicle owners. Also a text message sent to the owner's phone of possible theft.</p>
  
  <h3>FAQ'S</h3>
  
  <p>If any problems refer to manual.
 For quick trouble shooting? Wait 30 seconds and try again. If that fails  disconnect for power wait 2 minutes and connect and try again. If system fails please call (1800 000 000) (free call).</p>

 <h3>Personality test report</h3>
 
 <p>I agree with the test resualts in that, i do like to work alone sometimes but i can work with others, if they need me.I don't try and read to much into these kind of test resualts.</p>
