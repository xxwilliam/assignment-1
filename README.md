Education To Date Year 10 in 1989, Tafe cooking in 1990, Chubb Security in 2003, Certificate 3 in Security Ope

Rmit Introduction to IT in 2021 
 
Mt interest in IT came about when a friend of mine was chatting to a guy online from the USA. She was telling m
e all about him, 
like that he owned a Harley Davidson store, lived in a big house, and was very rich. She also told me he wanted h
er to fly to the USA. 
She was only a few months away from going ,so I did a Google search on his name, and found out a lot about him
, like he only worked a few days 
at the Harley Davidson store, and was'nt that good working in the store, his house was his mom's and he lived in t
he basement, and then I found 
out he has a criminal back ground which was very long, and 1 of the charges was assault on a female, and spent ti
me in Jail. I down loaded 
what I found and showed her ,at 1st she did'nt believe me so I told her to ask him a few questions, and I told her to
ring his work and ask 
to speak to the manager. After she did all that she found out I was right and had caught him out on his lies. 
 
I choose RMIT as it is very flexiable, online, easy to use and the tutors are a very good help and have a great kno
wledge of IT 
I expect to learn a lot form my studies to help me further my studies so I can reach my goal and study Cyber secu
rity. 
 
MY IDEAL JOB 
 
Security Specialist 
My role would be delivering Cyber Security out comes by my self or as part of a team, communicating with vend
ors, and outside authorities. 
I would have to have attention to detail for tracking complex security requirements across systems and domains, a
nd with Australian Government 
security requirements under PSPF,DSPF and ISM. An IT degree with Industry experience in security risk manage
ment in complex systems is preferable 
with certificates in ,CSSIP, CISM. CISA, and CPP. 
 
I hope to pass this course, then study introduction to programming, then on to Cyber security

MY PROJECT IDEA; 
 
THE G.E.C,A. 
 
OVER VIEW; 
 
A module fitted to a motor vehicle to help stop it getting stolen. The G,E,C,A stands for Gps tracking, Engine im
mobiliser, Camera, Alarm. 
The GPS will keep a log of the vehicle's location, Engine immobiliser will disable the engine, lock doors and win
dows, Cameras will record from 
out side the vehicle and in side as well, and Alarms will go off out side the vehicle. The vehicle's air conditioner o
r vent fan will still 
work so the occupants will not be affected by the hot or cold weather The whole unit can be built in the front or b
oot area of the vehicle, 
and wired into the vehicle's electrical system and ignition. 
 
MY MOTIVATION; 
 
This would be an asset to any vehicle owner, as there is approximately 19.8 million vehicle's registered in Australi
a as from 2020. This product 
would slow down vehicle theft in Australia, as there are close to 1.6 thefts per 1000 registered vehicles. That's clo
se to 56,300 motor 
vehicles stolen in 2019-2020. This is just an upgrade of other anti-theft systems but with a big difference. And tha
t difference is all this is in a package like they have on airplanes (black boxes) See description below. 
 
 
DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT; 
 
As the name suggests Gps ,Engine immobiliser, Camera and Alarm, lets discover what each 1 does; 
GPS Tracking; 
The Gps Tracker will work along side but not wired into the factory gps (if the vehicle has 1), it will have it's own
battery as a back up 
for the whole system. The GPS will log the trips on a hard drive and an SD card, so if the hard drive was damage
d the SD card would survive or vice 
versa. 
ENGINE IMMOBILISER; 
This will work seperate to the factory engine immobiliser ( if vehicle has 1) so if that was hacked or ket was clon
ed.The engine immobiliser would ki 
kick in after the vehicle was driven 50 meters,it woukd send a log to the hard drive and sd card,. The engine immo
biliser would keep motor vehicle 
engine running but only idleing so air conditioner or fan to work.It would send a message to the motor vehicle co
mmputer (most vehicles have a 
commptuer) most vehicles made before 1970-1980 willnot have a commputer. Also send a message to the brakes 
to close. 
CAMERAS; 
Cameras will be mounted on the front,rear and inside.These cameras will record just like normal vehicle cameras 
do,The in side camera will directly 
show the driver, have a mircrophone as well the record any voices from in side the vehicle,that can be used in cou
rt if needed.all this will be 
recorded on the hard drive and sd card. 
ALARMS; 
This alarm system will work seperatley to the factory alarm system just in caes that is disabled.The alarm will hav
e pre-recorded sounds up to 
100 decibels,along with a speaker in side saying in a calm voice to just relax and wait for help, and the alarm can 
be disabled by an APP om 
the owners ph.The alarm will go off every 5 secondes for 5 mins and then every 2 minutes after that for another 5 
mins.The alarm system will 
disable the door locks and electric windows(if applicable). 
This Idea is based on 2 current products already in use today.1 of those products is the factory and (after market) 
motor vehicle anti-theft 
systems.The other is the black box used in airplanes,the black box will be fire proof,and crash proof,and only acc
essed byt the owner of the motor 
vehicle with a special key. All parts can be fitted by an authorized person,who will have knowledge of a motor ve
hicles electrical systems , 
and mechanical knowledge. For things such as the Engine Managment systems including electric windows, doors 
locks, braking systems. 
 
Tools requrired will be the standard tools ,screw drivers,wire cutters,electrical tapr electrical tubing,spanners (ope
n ended and rind), 
electrical wire (12 gauge) and connectors for the vehicle's commputer 
The technologies required will be the sofe ware associated with the operating systems,such as engine immoblising
, power windows, dorr locks 
and braking systems. The soft ware for the camera will be in the same black box but run seperatly with its own ha
rd drive and as card. 
 
Skills required will need to be advanced in automotive,eg electrical and mechanical skills,like fitting parts to braki
ng systemsn engine 
managment systems,(commputer in vehical).Knowledge in to late model vehicles that run a carboeretta or fuel inj
ector systems,A cert 2 or higher in 
automotive electrical technoledge,a cert 2 or higher in automotive studies, commputer programming can take in b
etween 25 to 40 weeks or longer. 
 
 
The outcome if this idea was successful would be great for the motor vehicles owners knowing that no matter wha
t happens to there vehicles 
when stolen the people responsible would be caught and dealt with by the law,Insurence companies would lower t
here rates as this would 
be another safety add on to the vehicle.Police would catch more criminals faster, so more jails would be needed,,
so that means more jobs 
more guards needed, and a safer community as motor vehicle theft would go down and peace of mind for motor v
ehicle owners.
